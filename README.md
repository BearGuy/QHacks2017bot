# QHacks 2017 Facebook Messenger Bot

This project creates a Facebook Messenger bot, starting from
the quickstart located in [Messenger Platform docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).

Our bot will look to communicate with users about local events in and around Queens.
